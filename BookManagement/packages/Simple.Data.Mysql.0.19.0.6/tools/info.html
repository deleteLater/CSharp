<h1>Note</h1>
<p>
<strong>To use this package you need to have the Mysql .net connector (Mysql.Data.dll)</strong><br/>
The version of you choice will be loaded dynamically at run time. <br/>
This dynamic loading means that it's enough that the Mysql.Data.dll file is present in the same directory as <br/> Simple.Data.Mysql.Mysql40.dll at runtime. You don't have to take a dependency on the connector if you don't want to.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to get the connector is to install one of the available Mysql.Data packages from Nuget.<br/>
Run <strong>Install-Package Mysql.Data</strong> to get the latest version.<br/>
(This will however add a reference to your project)<br/>
<em>Note that the latest version of Mysql.Data to support Mysql 4.0 is 5.1.7.0, this version is available on Nuget</em>
</p>
<p>
The decision not to add a hard dependency on the Mysql.Data nuget package was made  <br/>
to enable users to use the connector that is most compatible with the Mysql Server version in their environment.
